# Iris-Species-Classification-Tutorial
* Studied about Machine Learning but don't know where to start using it from?
* Or you know the concepts but don't know how to implement them?
* Or are you a beginner in the field of Machine Learning and code tutorials or books are of too high a level for you that they start demotivating you?

If so, you are at the right place, becuase I have written this notebook keeping in view all the difficulties I have faced as a beginner (Python is not even my primary language, still I could make it ;) so why can't you?)

This tutorial is meant for beginners who have atleast some basic theoritical knowledge of fundamental Machine Learning concepts and are looking to implement them practically. We will use the famous Iris Dataset to predict the specie of an Iris flower, given its petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width.
